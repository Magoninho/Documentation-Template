                <h1>Welcome to OpenGL</h1>
                
                Welcome to the online book for learning OpenGL! Whether you are trying to learn OpenGL for academic purposes, to pursue
                a career or simply looking for a hobby, this book will teach you the basics, the intermediate, and all the advanced
                knowledge using modern (core-profile) OpenGL. The aim of LearnOpenGL is to show you all there is to modern OpenGL in an
                easy-to-understand fashion with clear examples, while also providing a useful reference for later studies.
                So why read these chapters?
                
                Throughout the internet there are thousands of documents, books, and resources on learning OpenGL, however, most of
                these resources are only focused on OpenGL's immediate mode (commonly referred to as the old OpenGL), are incomplete,
                lack proper documentation, or are not suited for your learning preferences. Therefore, my aim is to provide a platform
                that is both complete and easy to understand.

                If you enjoy reading content that provides step-by-step instructions, clear examples, and that won't throw you in the
                deep with millions of details, this book is probably for you. The chapters aim to be understandable for people without
                any graphics programming experience, but are still interesting to read for the more experienced users. We also discuss
                practical concepts that, with some added creativity, could turn your ideas into real 3D applications. If all of the
                previous sounds like someone that could be you, then by all means, please continue.
                What will you learn?
                
                The focus of these chapters are on Modern OpenGL. Learning (and using) modern OpenGL requires a strong knowledge of
                graphics programming and how OpenGL operates under the hood to really get the best of your experience. So we will start
                by discussing core graphics aspects, how OpenGL actually draws pixels to your screen, and how we can leverage that
                knowledge to create some funky looking effects.
                
                On top of the core knowledge we will discuss many useful techniques that you can use for your applications, like:
                traversing a scene, create beautiful lighting, load custom-made objects from a modelling program, do cool
                post-processing techniques, and much more. We also feature a walkthrough series where we actually create a small game
                based on our obtained OpenGL knowledge, so you will really get a feel of what it's like to actually do graphics
                programming.
                Where to start
                
                Learn OpenGL is free, and will always be free, for anyone who wants to start with graphics programming. All content is
                available here at the menu to your left. Simply hit the Introduction button and you're ready to start your journey!

                    <p>After 4 years, I finally did the Snake game. Since I started programming (almost 4 years ago), I dreamed of doing
                        this game, but I never did it.<br>
                        Now the game has 2 versions: Procedural programming version, and Object Oriented Programming version.</p>

                    <p>In the folder, there is a file called <code>settings.json</code>. Inside of this file, there are settings that
                        can be changed.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><code>"scale" : 10</code> - This changes the scale of the whole game (the size of the grids).</li>
                        <li><code>"initial_snake_size" : 5</code> - This changes the initial snake size. How many squares you want the
                            snake to begin with</li>
                        <li><code>"fruit_color" : [0, 255, 255]</code> - Set the color of the fruit. By default it is cyan, but you can
                            change to any color in RGB</li>
                        <li><code>"snake_color" : [255, 255, 255]</code> - Changes the snake color</li>
                        <li><code>"frame_rate" : 15</code> - This changes the framerate of the game. the higher, the faster.</li>
                        <li><code>"song_path" : "./song2.wav"</code> - This is the place where you can change the song that is played.
                            There is 2 songs in the main directory: <code>song.ogg</code> and <code>song2.wav</code>.
                            <code>song.ogg</code> is a song from Super Mario Land and <code>song2.wav</code> is just a song that I found
                            on the <a href="https://modarchive.org/">https://modarchive.org/</a> called “android - city of the night”.
                        </li>
                        <li><code>"screen_size" : 300</code> - This setting changes the width of the screen. Don’t worry about the
                            height because the game has an aspect ratio.</li>
                        <li><code>"collide_on_walls" : false"</code> - Change if the player will lose if it collides with the walls or
                            not (this option is only available for the object oriented version yet)</li>
